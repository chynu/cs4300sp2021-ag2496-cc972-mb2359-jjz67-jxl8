17328,['Sara Bareilles'],Love Song,"Head underwater and they tell me
To breathe easy for a while
The breathing gets harder, even I know that
Made room for me but it's too soon to see
If I'm happy in your hands
I'm unusually hard to hold onto
Blank stares at blank pages
No easy way to say this
You mean well, but you make this hard on me
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
 Today, yeah
I learned the hard way that they all say
Things you wanna hear
And my heavy heart
Sinks deep down under you
And your twisted words, your help just hurts
You are not what I thought you were
Hello to high and dry
Convinced me to please you
Made me think that I need this too
I'm trying to let you hear me as I am
I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you to stay
If all you have is leavin', I'ma need a better reason
To write you a love song today
Promise me
That you'll leave the light on
To help me see
With daylight, my guide, gone
'Cause I believe there's a way
You can love me because I say...
I won't write you a love song
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this, huh
Is that why you wanted a love song? 
'Cause you asked for it, 'cause you need one
You see, I'm not gonna write you a love song 
'Cause you tell me it's make or break in this
If you're on your way
I'm not gonna write you  to stay
If your heart is nowhere in it, I don't want it for a minute
Babe, I'll walk the seven seas 
When I believe that there's a reason
To write you  a love song today
Today , yeah"

17330,['Colbie Caillat'],Bubbly,"Will you count me in?
I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feeling like a child now
'Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place
It starts in my toes and I crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under covers, staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore
They start in my toes, make me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
But what am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way?
I just... Mmm
And it starts in my toes, makes me crinkle my nose
Wherever it goes, I always know
That you make me smile, please stay for a while now
Just take your time, wherever you go
Ta-da-dam, ta-da, da-dam, ta-da-dam, ta-da-da-da, ta-da-dam
Um-ba, da-da, um-ba, ta-da-da-da, uhm, mm-mmh
I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in, just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth
It starts in my soul and I lose all control
When you kiss my nose, the feeling shows
'Cause you make me smile, baby, just take your time now
Holding me tight
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever, wherever, wherever you go
Wherever you go, I always know
'Cause you make me smile, even just for a while"

17335,['The Dandy Warhols'],Bohemian Like You,"You got a great car
Yeah, what's wrong with it today?
I used to have one too
Maybe I'll come and have a look
I really love your hairdo, yeah
I'm glad you like mine too
See what looking pretty cool will get you
So what do you do?
Oh yeah, I wait tables too
No, I haven't heard your band
Cause you guys are pretty new
But if you dig on vegan food
Well come over to my work
I'll have them cook you something that you'll really love
Cause I like you
Yeah I like you
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you
Yeah I like you
Yeah I like you
And I feel woa-ho
Woo!
Whoa-ho-woo
Whoa-ho-woo
Whoa-ho-woo
Whoa-ho-woo
Wait!
Who's that guy just hanging at your pad?
He's looking kind of bummed
Yes, you broke up that's too bad
I guess it's fair if he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get all bent
About sleeping on the couch when I'm there
Cause I like you
Yeah I like you
And I'm feeling so Bohemian like you
Yeah I like you
Yeah I like you
And I feel woa-ho
Woo!
Whoa-ho-woo

And I feel so Bohemian like you
It's you that I want so please
Just a casual, casual easy thing
Is it? It is for me

17336,"['Kanye West', 'Chris Martin']",Homecoming,"Yeah
And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then? 
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again 
-Min' home again
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me
But my name is Windy and I like to blow trees.""
And from that point, I never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to toe 'em off
And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me.""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""'Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me!""
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do: just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Every interview, I'm representin' you, makin' you proud
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Loy-oy-al, loy-oy-al
Comin' home again
Maybe we can start again"
