If anything, it has\u00a0more\u00a0going on than\u00a0the debut,\u00a0but it\u2019s all done more tastefully, and the album\u2019s warm, open production makes it easier to take in just how sophisticated these arrangements are.\n", "Hayley Kiyoko": "Hayley Kiyoko\u2019s ambitious debut is at its best when it\u2019s barbed and confrontational, but the former Disney star is still trying to hone her budding pop star identity.\n", "Hit-Boy": "The Bay Area rap crew\u2019s collaboration with Hit-Boy catches them in a moment of furious flux.\n", "Hobo Johnson": "The second album from the viral star is crowded with histrionic vocals, tired emotions, and petty grievances, leaving little room to actually enjoy his music.\n", "Hole": "Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

In their sparkling music, every sound feels like a treasured memory.\n", "The Avett Brothers": "It\u2019s fitting that the Avett Brothers\u2019 most disappointing record yet bears the title of True Sadness. Is this some kind of play for the Top 40, or just instrumental bloat and trite sentiment?\n", "The B-52's": "Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the debut from the B-52s, a bastion of provocative post-punk unlike anything else.\n", "The Beatles": "After the discord of The Beatles, the group sought to get back to basics with a rock LP and a film about its creation.

But then it keeps going.\n", "The Decemberists": "On their seventh album, the Decemberists sound like a polite, modern folk rock band with only a touch of the usual antiquity. They seem wrapped up in themselves, wistful and mature, careful not to become caricatures while also trying to push their sound forward.\n", "The Drifters": "The latest from Alex Zhang Hungtai's reference-heavy experimental music project is a double album. One half offers some electronics-heavy twists on the desert noir songs of his last album,\u00a0Badlands, while the other veers into abstraction.

In 2015, he\u2019s not only one of the richest men in the biz, he\u2019s a tabloid star, and if you want vague, positive platitudes bouncing off every pocket of pixelated pomp, his second album, True Colors, is a one-stop shop.\n", "a-ha": "Providence-to-Portland duo the Body's second of two collaborations with New Orleans\u2019 Thou is a match made of mania and menace. During the last decade, both of these doom metal squads have issued records at startling clips, and You, Whom I Have Always Hated is a remarkably cohesive and singular album.\n", "alt-J": "Alt-J's debut album went Top 20 in the UK, and they're favorites to win November's Mercury Music Prize. The Cambridge-based pop band's been described as \"the new Radiohead,\" but that tag ultimately says more about lowered standards.\n", "blink-182": "Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.
